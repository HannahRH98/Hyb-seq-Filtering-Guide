# Hyb-seq-Filtering
Custom R script for filtering Hyb-seq data

These scripts are designed to use the outputs of the hybpiper_stats command to help decide on the best sample and gene/introns/supercontigs filtering strategies.

It is important to emphasise that these scripts are GUIDES only, and the decision to remove samples or genes/introns/supercontigs should also be made based upon importance of samples/genes/introns/supercontigs and questions
being asked by the researchers.

We are happy for users to suggest improvements.

Happy filtering!
