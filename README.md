# Hyb-seq-Filtering
Custom R script for filtering Hyb-seq data

These scripts are designed to use the outputs of the hybpiper_stats command to help GUIDE on the best sample and gene/supercontigs filtering strategies.

It is important to emphasise that these scripts are GUIDES only, and the decision to remove samples or genes/supercontigs should also be made based upon importance of samples/genes/supercontigs and questions being asked by the researchers.
